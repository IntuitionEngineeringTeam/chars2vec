    long_description="Chars2vec library could be very useful if you are dealing with the texts \
                        containing abbreviations, slang, typos, or some other specific textual dataset. \
                        Chars2vec language model is based on the symbolic representation of words â€“ \
                        the model maps each word to a vector of a fixed length. \
                        These vector representations are obtained with a custom neural netowrk while \
                        the latter is being trained on pairs of similar and non-similar words. \
                        This custom neural net includes LSTM, reading sequences of characters in words, as its part. \
                        The model maps similarly written words to proximal vectors. \
                        This approach enables creation of an embedding in vector space for any sequence of characters.\
                        Chars2vec models does not keep any dictionary of embeddings, \
                        but generates embedding vectors inplace using pretrained model. \
                        There are pretrained models of dimensions 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 for the English language.\
                        The library provides convenient user API to train a model for an arbitrary set of characters.",
